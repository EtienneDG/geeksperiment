Ok this is it: the _first article_ on the blog! I thought that coming back on how to put up a coding blog in short time could be a good warm up.

Let&rsquo;s set aside the hosting and Domain Name stuff and get directly into the site itself. 

Content Management System (CMS), pick yours:

<img src="http://geeksperiment.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/drupal.png" alt="drupal-logo" style="width:50px;"> [Drupal](http://drupal.org/download)   
<img src="http://geeksperiment.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/icon13.png" alt="joomla-logo" style="width:50px;">[Joomla](http://www.joomla.org/download.html) 
              
  I chose WordPress, which is the most used CMS worldwide (see the figures <a href="http://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/content_management/all">here</a>) for its simple Back Office and its numerous plugins. Talking about plugins/tools here are a few that I use and that come in handy:


<ul>
  <li>
    Themes plugins: if you you don&rsquo;t feel like an artist (just yet), there are LOTS of free WP themes available and customizable
  </li>
  <li>
    Google analytics: the WordPress plugin doesn&rsquo;t to work anymore, so the best way si to manually add GA code to your template header
  </li>
  <li>
    AddThis: add share and follow buttons for social networks
  </li>
  <li>
    WP Code Highlight: everything is in the name :p
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Alright ready to code and share!
