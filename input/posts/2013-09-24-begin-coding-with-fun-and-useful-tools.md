&laquo;&nbsp;Coders are like musicians&nbsp;&raquo;&#8230;

&nbsp;

I recently read that on a blog ([french only](http://www.geek-directeur-technique.com/2013/07/08/si-les-informaticiens-etaient-des-sportifs-ou-des-musiciens), sorry). I fully aggree with that statement: you learn new techniques, new songs, you have to practice.<!--more-->

As for guitar with tablatures, you can step easily into coding with various apps and sites. I tried a few of them:

&nbsp;

# Codecademy

Codecademy is a learning site for futur web devs. Some will say that it&rsquo;s the Guitar Hero for coding: because it&rsquo;s very guided and doesn&rsquo;t require a lot of skills. You can learn the basics of web programming languages and programmation. The exercices are in general quite simple but allow you to review a lot of notions. The strenght of the site is that it&rsquo;s very very fun, with its badge system and it&rsquo;s design. The execrices are structured in courses that you can start and finish later. 

<li class="liPros">
  Very fun (over-achievers this site is made for you!)
</li>
<li class="liPros">
  A lot of exercices available
</li>
<li class="liPros">
  Nice (new) dark interface
</li>
<li class="liPros">
  Courses on APIs, such as youtube, soundcloud, twitter,&#8230;
</li>

<li class="liCons">
  Some execrices tend to repeat previous ones
</li>
<li class="liCons">
  Won&rsquo;t make you an expert / isn&rsquo;t enough
</li>

#### For who?

For total beginners or for those we want to quickly learn a new language and get ready to start a project of their own.

&nbsp;

# Programmr

Unlike Codecademy, Programmr is less didactive. The execrices are more difficult and there are no tips/guideline to find the solution to the problem. In addition to that, each execrcie must finished in a time limit (pressure!). The exercices are a bit scholar though. Concerning the interface, it is less sexy than Codecademy&rsquo;s but it is practical and it does the job.

<li class="liPros">
  A lot of languages, includind non web-based.
</li>
<li class="liPros">
  Challenging and mind teasing
</li>

<li class="liCons">
  Not so reliable (unavailability, problem with JVM when running code)
</li>
<li class="liCons">
  Weak results validation&#8230;
</li>

#### For who?

For intermediate programmers and people who want the challenge!

&nbsp;

# jsFiddle

This is a not a learning site per say, it is more like a sandbox in wich you can learn how to build castles. A really neat interface for this alpha version that gives you the possibility to write few lines of code and instantly see the results. I love this site, you can create, modify and run code snippets and then you can of course share it via URL or social networks. A feature that I&rsquo;d like to see on jsFiddle is an export to GitHub as files that would bring jsFiddle to be a great web-based IDE.

<li class="liPros">
  Various frameworks support (with version specific)
</li>
<li class="liPros">
  jsLint validation
</li>
<li class="liPros">
  Easy sharing
</li>

<li class="liCons">
  None! =P
</li>

I&rsquo;m know that there are quite a lot of other tools around the corner, fell free to share yours ðŸ™‚

[UPDATE]

I presented only the tools I&rsquo;ve been using regularly, you can find a more complete list on:
